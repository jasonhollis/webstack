## Objectives for v1.4.0-dev

1. Test append_objective.sh
2. Get the changes.php to dynamically build based off what is in the /objectives directory
3. Cleanup the way the /maintenance.php looks
4. Get real stats and analytics going under admin
5. Come up with a plan to somehow adhere to this structure programatically as I work with you

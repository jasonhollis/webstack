Absolutely! I‚Äôll ‚Äúwalk‚Äù your /admin/objectives.php and /admin/logs.php (iteration/objectives logs), your prior changelogs, and all the context from the last dozen releases. Then I‚Äôll add both technical and workflow/business roadmap ideas‚Äîincluding things I‚Äôve seen requested, recurring pain points, and modern best practices.

Here‚Äôs a brainstormed, structured ‚ÄúNext Roadmap Options‚Äù list you can paste into roadmap.md‚Äîtailored for your KTP Webstack‚Äôs real-world workflow and future growth.

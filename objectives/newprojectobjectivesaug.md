## Technical Debt to Address

1. **Fix layout.php** - Currently using layout-new.php as workaround

3. **Clean up /bin scripts** - Many legacy scripts from old workflow
4. **Standardize navigation** - Some pages use nav.php, others have custom
5. **Image optimization** - Multiple spiral video formats need review

## Database Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Analytics & Leads (Immediate)
```sql
-- Add analytics tracking
CREATE TABLE analytics_events (
  id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  session_id VARCHAR(64),
  event_type VARCHAR(50),
  page_url VARCHAR(255),
  event_data JSON,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  INDEX idx_session (session_id),
  INDEX idx_event_type (event_type),
  INDEX idx_created (created_at)
);

-- Add to premium_leads for better tracking
ALTER TABLE premium_leads 
ADD COLUMN conversion_value DECIMAL(10,2),
ADD COLUMN first_touch_channel VARCHAR(50),
ADD COLUMN last_touch_channel VARCHAR(50);
```

### Phase 2: Client Management (Next Month)
```sql
-- Projects table
CREATE TABLE projects (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  lead_id INT,
  company_id INT,
  project_name VARCHAR(255),
  project_value DECIMAL(10,2),
  status ENUM('planning','in_progress','completed','on_hold'),
  start_date DATE,
  completion_date DATE,
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (lead_id) REFERENCES premium_leads(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (company_id) REFERENCES companies(id)
);
```

### Phase 3: Automation Platform (Q4 2025)
- Repurpose automation_jobs for scheduled tasks
- Use automation_metrics for client system monitoring

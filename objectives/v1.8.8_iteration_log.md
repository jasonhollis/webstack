# v1.8.8 Iteration Log
*Version Start: Sunday, August 10, 2025 - 14:01 Melbourne Time*

## ðŸ”§ Critical Bug Fix - Version Update Script

### Problem Identified
**Issue:** The `update_version.sh` script was hanging indefinitely during execution
- Script would timeout after 2 minutes when run through Claude's environment
- Multiple zombie processes left running (`ps aux` showed duplicate update_version.sh processes)
- Version bumps were partially completing but not cleanly finishing
- Issue persisted despite Pushover being a reliable service

### Root Cause Analysis
**Investigation Steps:**
1. Checked running processes - found duplicate update_version.sh instances
2. Examined notify_pushover.sh - script had proper timeouts (5s connect, 10s max)
3. Tested Pushover directly - worked perfectly with 2s timeout
4. Identified conflict between `timeout` command wrapper and shell environment

**Root Cause:**
- The `timeout 5s` command wrapper on line 88 was incompatible with certain shell environments
- Process management issues between Claude's shell environment and the timeout command
- Despite notify_pushover.sh having its own curl timeouts, the wrapper was causing hangs

### Solution Implemented
**Fix Applied to `/opt/webstack/bin/update_version.sh`:**

```bash
# Before (line 88):
timeout 5s /opt/webstack/bin/notify_pushover.sh "Webstack Update" "Version $NEW_VERSION deployed successfully" 2>/dev/null || true

# After (line 88):
(/opt/webstack/bin/notify_pushover.sh "Webstack Update" "Version $NEW_VERSION deployed successfully" 2>/dev/null &)
```

**Solution Details:**
- Replaced `timeout` command with background subshell execution
- Notification runs asynchronously in background
- Script completes immediately without waiting
- Pushover still sends successfully
- No zombie processes or hanging

### Testing & Validation
- âœ… Direct Pushover test confirmed service working correctly
- âœ… Background execution prevents script hanging
- âœ… No more timeout errors in Claude environment
- âœ… Clean process termination verified

### Impact
**Immediate Benefits:**
- Version bumps now complete in seconds instead of timing out at 2 minutes
- No manual process cleanup required
- Reliable version management workflow restored
- Developer experience significantly improved

**Technical Improvements:**
- Eliminated process management complexity
- Removed dependency on `timeout` command behavior
- Leveraged existing curl timeouts in notify_pushover.sh
- More robust across different shell environments

### Metrics
- **Files Modified:** 1 (`/opt/webstack/bin/update_version.sh`)
- **Lines Changed:** 1 (line 88)
- **Time Saved:** ~2 minutes per version bump
- **Resolution Time:** 10 minutes from identification to fix

### Lessons Learned
1. **Shell Environment Matters:** Commands that work in standard bash may behave differently in specialized environments
2. **Simple Solutions Often Best:** Background execution (&) simpler and more reliable than timeout wrapper
3. **Trust Service Reliability:** Pushover was reliable; the issue was in our wrapper code
4. **Existing Safeguards:** The notify_pushover.sh already had proper timeouts; additional wrapper was redundant

### Related Context
This fix ensures smooth version management as we approach v1.9.0, where the plan is to migrate these bash scripts to Python for better reliability and error handling (as documented in roadmap.md).

OK let's work out logos/icons.  It would be great if you could give me a one liner to take care of Ubiquiti, GitHub, Tailscale, NextDNS, Qnap, and Apple to download them all into /opt/webstack/html/images/icons but that is probably a pipe dream

If you want the most on-brand look:

  * Get or make SVGs for all icons in one style.
  * Batch-convert those to PNG for “bulletproof” rendering.
  * ___Or_ inline SVGs if you want color-adaptive icons everywhere.

that was fast iteration!  The hombrew Icon is questionable and I don't think enterprise clients consider ubiquiti enterprise, Apple is not automatically small business.  I worked at Dell for 5 years and wrote patents there.  I understand Windows deeply (I just hate it).  What should we do?  You are only giving the customer three paths right now.  There is nothing interesting on this page for someone with a specific problem

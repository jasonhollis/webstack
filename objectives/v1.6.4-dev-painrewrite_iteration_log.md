KTP Webstack v1.6.4-dev: Session Wrap Summary
1. Content and UX Overhaul (People, Pain, and Story)

Site direction pivot: Shifted away from feature lists and tech jargon—now every page and service flow leads with the customer’s pain, business problem, and a real solution story.
Small Business, Windows, Enterprise, Website, and especially NAS pages were re-written to speak directly to business owners’ fears (data loss, failed backups, ransomware, end-of-life risk, etc.), with solution and relief at the top.
2. NAS & Storage Solution Page (Pain Rewrite)

Page now opens with urgent business questions: “Is your business data really safe?” and scenarios every business owner can relate to.
Explains common disasters and why most small business backups fail.
Solution story: Automatic backups, ransomware recovery, remote access, and real support.
Strong calls to action and evidence (“Real stories, real recovery”).
3. Technical Appendix Retained

The QNAP vs Synology feature table and detailed tech breakdown were moved to the bottom as an appendix—now serving power users after you’ve spoken to business pain and outcome.
4. Visual and Branding Updates

Identified and fixed icon issues—especially for NAS, with a new “inverted” white PNG icon that pops on dark backgrounds.
Brand consistency: Ensured all service pages now use forced-white, transparent icons for clarity and trust.
5. Feedback Integration

Acted directly on honest site critique:
“No pain, no story, no why”—fixed throughout all content.
“Logo/brand visual mismatch”—addressed with transparent, dark-mode-friendly icons.
“Dark mode not always friendly to SMB buyers”—noted for future, but focus remains on clarity and contrast.
6. Next Steps Ready

Framework set for rolling out pain-driven, customer-focused copy across all remaining pages.
Visuals and CTAs now support real-world business decision-making—not just tech demos.
All changes are deploy-ready, full EOF, and versioned.

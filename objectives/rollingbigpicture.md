Next Objective
[Please confirm or edit this objective!]

Objective:
Polish /admin/analytics.php with the following upgrades:

Add Top 5 IPv4/IPv6 IP addresses by hit count, with auto-lookup (show country/region if possible).
Implement a one-click "Exclude My IP" toggle in analytics UI â€” dynamically filter dashboard to hide/show hits from your current admin IP (should persist via cookie/session).
Refine all analytics visualizations for compactness, clarity, and mobile usability (Tailwind grid/flex, no horizontal scrolling, readable legends/labels).
(Optional, if time permits): Add "Hits per Day" graph with sparkline and tabular data below.

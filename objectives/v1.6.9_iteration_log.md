**Release Summary – v1.6.10-dev**

**1. New HA icon–fetcher script**

* Added `/opt/webstack/bin/fetch_ha_icons.sh`

  * Pulls PNG icons for every domain in `ha_integrations.json` from `brands.home-assistant.io`
  * Writes timestamped logs to `/opt/webstack/logs/`
  * Fully absolute paths and `set -euo pipefail` for reliability

**2. Dynamic integrations JSON pipeline**

* Continued use of `build_ha_integrations.py` and `fetch_ha_logos.py` to scrape and normalize Home Assistant integration data
* Ensured `ha_integrations.json` lives under `/opt/webstack/html/data/` with up-to-date slug, label, URL, and logo entries

**3. Landing page overhaul (`landing.php`)**

* **Top section**: retained the Home Assistant “network matrix” visualization around our central logo
* **Middle section**: restored three real-world example panels (“Integrations”, “Zigbee Network”, second “Integrations”) with click-to-zoom images
* **Bottom section**: replaced hard-coded icons with the **Integration Grid Test**–style card layout

  * Dynamically reads `/data/ha_integrations.json`
  * Displays each integration’s locally cached SVG/PNG icon (fallback to generic if missing)
  * Links each card to the official HA docs

**4. Styling refinements**

* Unified grid card styles (rounded white cards, hover shadows, consistent padding) across both landing and test pages
* Consolidated CSS for matrix, examples, and grid into one clean `<style>` block

**5. Verification & Next Steps**

* Manually ran `fetch_ha_icons.sh`—all icons now in `/html/images/icons/`
* Landing page reviewed in-browser: top, mid, and bottom panels display correctly and match design
* **Next**: schedule the icon-fetcher via cron or CI, and bump to v1.6.10 in `VERSION`

All changes adhere to our full-EOF file-replacement policy and have been logged. Let me know if you’d like any tweaks or to proceed with the cron setup!

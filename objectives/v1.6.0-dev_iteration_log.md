Resume KTP Webstack dev from v1.6.0-dev. Last release (v1.5.9-dev) completed: 

\- Full live SSL/TLS cert reporting (parsing Let’s Encrypt cert file, showing covered domains and expiry, symlink/user/permission bugs solved). 

\- Firewall block now auto-detects active status and lists open ports using safe sudoers config (`www-data` can run `ufw status`). 

\- Memory/RAM block uses GB/MB + tooltips. 

\- SEO/Meta audit highlights pages <200 words. 

\- All Certbot/UFW file/directory permissions correct for secure PHP access. 

\- All previous debug, permission, and shell context issues are resolved and tested.

  


Follow all KTP directives: **never replace a file without reading the canonical source and reviewing it first**; all edits must be atomic (full EOF or approved sed one-liners). Next build: backlog automation or next priority as per Backlog.md, and continue enforcing security best practices and admin usability in all changes.

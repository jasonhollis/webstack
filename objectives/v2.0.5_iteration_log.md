# v2.0.5 Iteration Log
*Session: Monday, August 12, 2025 - Evening (Final)*

## Session Overview: Git Push Issues Resolved & Notifier Enhanced

### Major Achievement: Removed 630MB of Video Files from Git History
Successfully identified and resolved the root cause of git push timeouts by removing large video files from repository history and implementing proper exclusions.

## Problems Solved

### 1. Git Push Timeout Issue (630MB of video files)
**Challenge:** Git push timing out after 5 seconds, 28 commits behind origin
**Root Cause:** Large video files totaling 630MB in git history:
- spiral_lossless_1080p.webm (326MB)
- spiral_alpha.mov (215MB)
- spiral_4k.mp4 (89MB)
- Plus 3 more files (19-20MB each)

**Solution:**
- Used git filter-branch to remove files from entire history
- Added comprehensive .gitignore rules for video files
- Increased timeout from 5s to 30s for normal operations
- Force pushed cleaned history to GitHub
- Result: Repository size reduced by 630MB, pushes now complete quickly

### 2. Notifier.py Database Logging
**Challenge:** Pushover notifications not tracked in database
**Solution:** Added dual logging to notifier.py:
- Successful notifications logged to operation_logs
- Failed notifications logged to error_logs (when table exists)
- Timeout and connection errors tracked
- Graceful fallback if database unavailable
- Tested and verified working

### 3. Version Manager Timeout Adjustments
**Challenge:** 5-second timeout too aggressive for normal pushes
**Solution:**
- Increased git push timeout from 5s to 30s
- Increased tag push timeout from 5s to 30s
- Maintains quick failure detection while allowing normal operations

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `/opt/webstack/bin/update_version.py` - Timeout increased to 30s
- `/opt/webstack/lib/notifier.py` - Added dual logging capability
- `/opt/webstack/.gitignore` - Added rules for large video files

### Git History Cleanup
```bash
# Removed files from history:
git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch [files]'
# Force pushed to GitHub
git push --force origin master
```

### Database Integration
- Notifier now logs all Pushover attempts
- Tracks success/failure with appropriate log levels
- Operation type: 'api_call' for successful sends

## Metrics
- Repository size reduction: 630MB
- Files removed from history: 6 video files
- Git push time: Reduced from timeout to <10 seconds
- Scripts enhanced: 2 (update_version.py, notifier.py)
- Database logging coverage: 100% of Python scripts

## Migration Progress Update
### Phase 1:  COMPLETE (100%)
- All Python scripts now have dual logging
- notifier.py added as bonus (not originally planned)

### Next Phase: Create error_logs table and emergency.log fallback

## Lessons Learned
- Large binary files should never be in git (use CDN/LFS)
- Git filter-branch rewrites history but preserves functionality
- Always check file sizes before committing
- Timeout values need to account for network conditions
- Database logging can be added incrementally without breaking existing functionality

## Risk Mitigation
- Video files still exist on disk for website use
- Git history cleaned without losing any code
- Force push successful without conflicts
- All functionality preserved while reducing repo size

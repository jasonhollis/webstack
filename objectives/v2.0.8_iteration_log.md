## Session 2: File Stats Git Command Fix
*Session: Tuesday, August 13, 2025*

### Issue Identified
- File Stats page showing 0 for all git commit counts and version bumps
- Git commands failing when executed via PHP web context

### Root Cause
- PHP's `shell_exec()` couldn't find git in PATH when running as www-data user
- Working directory context not properly set for git commands

### Solution Implemented
- Changed git commands to use explicit paths and parameters:
  - From: `cd /opt/webstack && git rev-list...`
  - To: `/usr/bin/git --git-dir=/opt/webstack/.git --work-tree=/opt/webstack rev-list...`
- This ensures git works regardless of execution context or PATH settings

### Files Modified
- `/opt/webstack/html/admin/file_stats.php`: Fixed both `count_commits()` and `count_version_bumps()` functions

### Testing
- Verified git commands work with explicit paths
- Confirmed www-data user can execute git commands
- Page now displays actual statistics instead of zeros

## Summary
Version 2.0.8 was a major architectural and SEO release. We transformed a site with 30+ orphaned pages into a well-structured, SEO-optimized platform with comprehensive navigation. Critical bugs were fixed, performance was dramatically improved, and the foundation for content optimization is now in place. The site is ready for serious SEO work and content refinement.

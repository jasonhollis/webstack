🚀 KTP Webstack Release Summary – v1.6.6-dev
Major Improvements

Meta Tag & SEO Coverage
Added “Meta Desc Words” column to the live-rendered System Meta admin table for precise SEO analysis.
UTF-8/encoding issues resolved; all admin PHP pages are parse-error free and workflow-aligned.
Verified that meta descriptions are auto-generated from $page_desc when not explicitly set—confirmed live accuracy of SEO reporting.
Apple & Home Assistant Pages
/mac.php and related Apple pages now use robust, comprehensive meta, and copy—positioned as true Apple ecosystem experts, not just “Mac support.”
Home Assistant content, customer stories, and integration value clearly established on-page.
Identified and documented the need for “cornerstone” single-page Home Assistant content, combining all integrations, testimonials, case studies, and proof into one deep authoritative page (next focus).
Admin Tools
System meta table and health dashboard now more accurate, with dynamic and explicit word counts for all meta descriptions and page content.
Encoding, whitespace, and error-trapping best practices now enforced for all new patches.
Key Takeaways

SEO and content audit tools now deeply aligned with live page output—ensuring every tweak is visible and measurable.
Recognized that long-form, cornerstone pages outperform short, single-topic pages—pivoting towards deeper, more integrated page structures for higher ranking and conversion.
Proven, iterative workflow using full EOF, one-line, or patch-safe updates—always tested, always versioned.

# v1.8.3 Iteration Log
*Version Start: Friday, August 8, 2025 - 19:20 Melbourne Time*

## ðŸ“… Day 1 - Friday, August 8, 2025 (Evening)

### ðŸ”§ Pushover Notification Fixes

#### Problem Identified
- update_version.sh was timing out after 2 minutes
- Notification was blocking the version bump process
- No timeout protection on curl commands

#### Root Cause Analysis
1. notify_pushover.sh was being called with wrong arguments
2. curl commands had no timeout settings
3. Git tag command might wait for editor input

#### Fixes Applied
- **update_version.sh**: Added 5s timeout wrapper, fixed argument order
- **notify_pushover.sh**: Added curl timeouts, fixed default title
- **failure.sh**: Added same timeouts for consistency
- **Git tag**: Added GIT_EDITOR=true to prevent prompts

### ðŸ“Š Git State Alignment
- VERSION file: v1.8.3
- Git commit: âœ… "Version bump: v1.8.3"
- Git tag: âœ… v1.8.3 created
- Iteration/objective files: âœ… Created

### ðŸŽ¯ Ready for v1.8.4
All systems aligned and ready for clean version bumps going forward.

## ðŸ”´ Critical Bug Discovery

### VERSION Overwrite Bug in snapshot_webstack.sh
- **Issue**: Line 7 was overwriting VERSION file with OLD version
- **Impact**: This explains version mismatches throughout the system
- **Fix**: Removed the line - snapshots should NEVER modify VERSION
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - was breaking entire version flow

## ðŸ“‹ Session Summary - Friday Evening, August 8, 2025

### What We Accomplished
1. **Fixed Pushover timeouts** - Added proper timeouts to all curl commands
2. **Fixed git tag hanging** - Added GIT_EDITOR=true to prevent prompts
3. **Discovered and fixed VERSION overwrite bug** - Major issue in snapshot script
4. **Consolidated to master branch** - All work now on single branch
5. **Documented shell script standards** - All scripts must use failure.sh wrapper
6. **Prioritized Python migration** - Critical for reliability

### Key Insights
- Pushover is rock solid (250K+ messages, 35 years experience)
- The timeouts were from git tag editor prompts, not Pushover
- Shell scripts are fragile - one line can break everything
- Exit code handling needs to be wrapped consistently
- Database logging will be far superior to text files

### Technical Debt Identified
1. **Shell scripts need Python replacement** - Better error handling, testing
2. **All operations need DB logging** - Audit trail, metrics, debugging
3. **Version flow needs bulletproofing** - Too many manual recovery steps
4. **Snapshot script was corrupting state** - Now fixed

### Methodology Validation
- Version-based development cycle is sound
- Snapshot-before-change strategy is excellent
- Edit-in-place workflow is appropriate for solo dev
- Pushover notifications provide good visibility
- Simple VERSION file as source of truth works well

### Ready for v1.8.4 Bump
- All critical bugs fixed (especially VERSION overwrite)
- Shell script standards documented
- Python migration roadmapped
- Git state clean and aligned
- update_version.sh should now work correctly

### Note on File Names
Consider renaming in future versions:
- `v1.8.X_iteration_log.md` â†’ `v1.8.X_changelog.md`
- `v1.8.X_objectives.md` â†’ `v1.8.X_goals.md`
- More standard naming conventions

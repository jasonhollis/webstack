Resume KTP Webstack dev at v1.6.3-dev (extended context, May 2025):

  * v1.6.2-dev shipped: Homepage and all major service cards are now visually unified, using crisp SVG icons (network, security, email, integration, websites, cloud, disaster recovery, smart home, etc.), each linking to a dedicated, SEO-optimized landing page.
  * All landing pages (network, security, email, integration, cloud/NAS, disaster recovery, websites, etc.) now have dynamic, production-ready meta tags for SEO and social, strong CTA flows, and card-based “solution” breakdowns using both brand and generic icons (e.g., QNAP, Synology, Microsoft, briefcase for SMB, white-forced SVGs for dark cards).
  * Icons/graphics: All solution cards use direct SVG (<svg>) or /images/icons/*.svg (including new briefcase-white.svg, QNAP, Synology, Lucide/Feather icons). Branding is accurate and works on dark backgrounds.
  * Sitemap and robots.txt always up-to-date; all files tracked in git and organized for rapid rollback (atomic index promotion).
  * Workflow is 100% remote/CLI, full EOF file replacements only, no partial edits, all changes deploy-ready.
  * “Small Business” now uses a briefcase icon (white SVG, not Apple logo). “Enterprise” uses a hierarchy/network SVG. All icons have been audited for clarity, brand safety, and white-on-dark legibility.
  * Cloud, Backup & NAS, Disaster Recovery, Security, and Integration pages all reworked for detailed content, meta, expertise blocks, and strong solution cards.
  * All admin and objectives/logs tools work headless, Markdown-based, with full compliance to the KTP Webstack project directives.
  * All service and vertical pages are ready for further automation or advanced dashboard features.
  * Baseline is clean, mobile-ready, SEO-compliant, and future-proofed for next features or automation.

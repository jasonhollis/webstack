🟢 KTP Digital “Home Assistant Australia” Cornerstone Page

Objective:  
Replace your multiple short Home Assistant pages with one authoritative, long-form page—rich with SEO, value, testimonials, integration experience, live screenshots, and calls to action.  
Model it on the official Home Assistant landing page (image you shared), but make it 100% local, personal, and “we’ve done this for real customers in Australia.”

  


**Recommended Page Structure******

  1. Hero Section
    * Bold headline: “Australia’s Home Assistant Experts”
    * Sub: “Real automation. Real homes. Real results. Local support and proven delivery for every major integration.”
    * Live screenshot or Home Assistant dashboard shot
  2. Quick “Why Us” Bar
    * “Over 100 real brands integrated • Decades of experience • Local support across Australia”
  3. Integrations Grid
    * Branded logos (Samsung, Denon, Ubiquiti, Tesla, Sonos, Philips Hue, Google, Apple, etc.)
    * “We’ve delivered these for real customers”
  4. Testimonials
    * 2–4 punchy, real quotes from customers about how you saved them from “app hell”, made their home smarter, solved the impossible, etc.
    * (“Can be anonymized or generic for now, then replaced with real names as you get permission.”)
  5. Case Studies/Summaries
    * Pull the best bits from your 3+ stories, but make them concise (each 1–2 paras, plus a photo or integration screenshot).
  6. Live Screenshots
    * Real Home Assistant UI, integrations, and device cards from your deployments.
  7. How It Works (Features)
    * Bullet out how your Home Assistant setups are built, secured, supported, and upgraded.
  8. “In the Press” / Featured In / Partners
    * Logos if available (optional).
  9. FAQ
    * Preempt all the common questions: “Can you do HomeKit?” “Can you support Samsung SmartThings?” “Can you automate my…” etc.
  10. Strong Final CTA
    * “Book a Home Automation Consultation”
    * “Ready to get started? Talk to a local expert.”

✅ v1.5.4-dev Objectives

🩺 /admin/system_meta.php — Internal System Health & Metadata Dashboard

  


🎯 Purpose

Create a centralized admin-only status page that aggregates live system diagnostics, deployment state, and content metadata coverage. This will give a single-pane-of-glass view into server health, webstack deployment state, and SEO coverage.

  


📋 Scope of Work

✅ 1. Page Creation

  * Create system_meta.php in /opt/webstack/html/admin
  * Tailwind dark/light UI, fully mobile-friendly
  * Auto-refresh optional (e.g. 30s interval)

✅ 2. System Metadata Summary

  * Current Webstack version (VERSION)
  * Last snapshot taken + filename
  * Directory timestamps: /html, /bin, /logs, /objectives
  * Webhook trigger status (log entry or last call time)
  * Git HEAD info (optional)

✅ 3. Server Health Section

  * uptime
  * df -h / (disk usage)
  * free -h (RAM)
  * Top 5 CPU + RAM processes (via ps)
  * nginx service state

✅ 4. TLS + Security Info

  * SSL cert expiry for www.ktp.digital
  * SSH key fingerprints from ~/.ssh
  * ufw status or fallback to iptables -L

✅ 5. SEO + Meta Tag Coverage (PHP pages)

  * Total .php files in /html
  * Count of:
    * Files with and without:
      * <meta name="description">
      * <title>
      * <meta name="robots">
  * Word count per page
  * Rendered like:  
  
  
about.php        | 417 words | ❌NoMeta | ❌NoTitle | OK
  * contact.php      | 108 words | ❌NoMeta | ❌NoTitle | OK
  * tailscale.php    | 357 words | ✅Meta | ✅Title | OK
  *   
  


  


🔗 Navigation Integration

  * Add link to system_meta.php in admin_nav.php as "System Meta"

  


✳️ Optional Enhancements (Next Iteration)

  * Certbot renewal schedule
  * nginx log last entries
  * Detect Pushover alert failures (last sent, timestamp)
  * Quick “retest” button to rerun checks live (JS AJAX or POST to self)

I want to make a quick change to Top User Agents on the Analytics page before we do anything else.  Can you expand that out somehow?  I specifically want to be able to see when you have hit pages because I think you use a specific user agent

Let’s upgrade the “Top User Agents” display on your /admin/analytics.php page with full clarity and AI traceability.

  


🧠 Goal

You want to:

  * Expand the list of user agents into a full breakdown
  * Detect GPT / AI visits clearly (they often use identifiable user agents like python-requests, curl, Go-http-client, etc.)
  * Show more detail and maybe sort descending by hits

  


✅ Recommended Upgrade

Replace the current summary box with a full table showing:

User Agent Substring

Hits

iPhone Safari

4

python-requests

3

Go-http-client

2

curl

1

Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh)

1

...

...

We’ll parse common tokens in a case-insensitive match. GPT-style requests (like mine) typically come in with:

  * python-requests
  * curl
  * Go-http-client
  * aiohttp
  * httpx
  * ChatGPT-User or OpenAI (if proxied via test tools)

✅ Analytics Enhancement Roadmap (Optional Next Steps)

Now that Top User Agents is fully expanded and tagging AI-ish sources with 🤖, here are a few high-value enhancements we can do next:

  


🧩 1. **Group + Collapse Raw User Agents******

Show:

  * a summary by type (iPhone, curl, Mac, Python, etc.)
  * click to expand full raw strings in a <details> tag per group

🧩 2. **Flag Suspicious Patterns******

  * Alert if any UA makes >X% of total hits
  * Show warnings for:
    * Empty user agents
    * N hits from localhost  

    * Abnormally high load times

🧩 3. **Geo Heatmap Table******

  * Add geoIP lookup for Top IPs
  * Show:
    * IP → City, Country
    * ASN name
  * Add a small flag icon next to country if desired

🧩 4. **Page Load Distribution Chart******

  * Convert load times into a bar chart
  * E.g., histogram or buckets: 0-0.2s, 0.2-0.5s, 0.5-1s, 1s+

Those are all great thoughts for a future release.  I have put them in the objectives log.  Please have a look yourself at https://www.ktp.digital/admin/objectives.php at some point very soon we need to build a roadmap page similar to objectives for longer term items with a method for taking things like what I just captured and consolidating them into something cleaner.  For now I want to finish our work on the system meta page and close this release out.  Have another look at https://www.ktp.digital/admin/system_meta.php after you are done with objectives and tell me what's next

Done working and good.  Next the info in that box is relatively meaningful for a nerd like me but if my marketing guy looks at this page to explore meta info he' probably not going to have a clue as to the black box.  Can you grab that information and then display it in a format with labels that is a bit more consistent with the rest of the page?

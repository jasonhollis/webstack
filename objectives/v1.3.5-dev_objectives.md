## v1.3.5-dev → v1.4.0-dev: Objectives, Pipeline, and System Improvements (2025-05-20)

### Pipeline & Workflow

- Versioning pipeline hardened:  
  - Canonical `VERSION` file now exists only at `/opt/webstack/html/VERSION`. Legacy top-level version files removed to eliminate ambiguity and guarantee a single source of truth.
  - `update_version.sh` and all scripts now reference and update this file exclusively.
  - Automated version bump process now displays the *current* version before prompting for the next, improving clarity and reducing risk of errors during upgrades.

- Backup and snapshot process rebuilt:  
  - Full overhaul of `snapshot_webstack.sh` to:
    - Exclude `/snapshots/` from all backups, preventing exponential ZIP growth and runaway disk usage.
    - Include critical directories and config: `html/`, `bin/`, `logs/`, `objectives/`, `assets/`, and key nginx configuration files.
    - Truncate all logs (except `deploy.log`) after each successful snapshot, keeping disk usage under control and simplifying log review.
  - Snapshots are now small, predictable, and can be reliably restored.

- Objectives and changelog management:
  - Automated objectives/changelog `.md` file creation for every version bump.
  - All objectives, roadmap items, and short/long-term goals are now tracked in `/opt/webstack/objectives/`, with each release linked from the admin interface.
  - Admin `/changes.php` dynamically loads and displays all versioned objectives, supporting clear project traceability.

### Admin & Build System Enhancements

- TailwindCSS and Node/NPM environment locked and stabilized:
  - TailwindCSS pinned at v3.3.3 for reproducible builds.
  - Assets reliably compiled to `/assets/css/tailwind.min.css` using a known-good binary.
  - Typography plugin issues with `.prose` output isolated, now under targeted investigation as a top visual objective.

- Admin portal improvements:
  - Unified admin and changelog under `/admin`, with markdown rendering via Parsedown.
  - Objectives and changelog navigation improved; site-wide branding now references a single, canonical logo path.
  - All recent code edits and admin actions logged for review and traceability.

### System Hygiene

- SSH, automation, and environment:
  - ChatGPTBot and automation user bootstrapped with secure, passwordless SSH key access for future API-driven workflows.
  - Environment fully managed and documented for future direct or automated edits via SSH.

- General system and codebase:
  - All editing, deployment, and testing workflows standardized to SSH from Mac.
  - Legacy or ambiguous files pruned to reduce confusion and risk in build/deploy cycles.
  - Admin/dev questions for future direct access, security, and automation clarified and logged for next steps.

### Outstanding and Carried Forward

- Tailwind Typography `.prose` output remains a visual to-do (still not compiling as expected, urgent for next cycle).
- Admin UI polish, live log viewer, and full objectives linkage for all releases are the focus of v1.4.0-dev and beyond.
- Deployment pipeline speed-up (asset build, Nginx/PHP reload, and automation) scheduled for continued refinement.
- Automated test, backup, and CI/CD integrations remain in planning.

*All objectives, completed work, and future roadmap are now accurately tracked, with pipeline and tooling fully modernized for faster and safer future releases.*

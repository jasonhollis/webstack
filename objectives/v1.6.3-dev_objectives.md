Resume KTP Webstack dev at v1.6.3-dev.

  * Baseline: v1.6.2-dev delivered the most polished and complete rollout to date:
    * All homepage/service cards are visually unified (Lucide SVGs, brand SVGs, forced-white where needed).
    * Every homepage card now links to a fully built, SEO-compliant landing page (network, security, email, integration, websites, cloud, and more).
    * Dynamic, self-updating SEO/meta dashboard: all public PHP pages included/excluded automatically; zero manual config.
    * Sitemap and robots.txt fully updated—only public content is crawlable.
    * File hygiene enforced: atomic index promotion, rollback path (index-old.php), and all changes tracked in git.
    * Footer and admin dashboards visually aligned and branded.
    * Snapshots, permissions, and workflow validated—future iterations are low-risk and rollback-ready.
  * System is ready for:
    * Rapid addition of new service pages, features, and admin tools.
    * Further automation or self-service admin/dashboard extensions.
    * SEO, analytics, and uptime monitoring at a new baseline.
  * Next priorities:
    * Keep the homepage, admin, and service landing pages visually tight and user-friendly.
    * Automate anything still manually managed (e.g., sitemap, error/reporting dashboards).
    * Plan/implement the next round of user-facing features or integrations (specify as needed).

# PROJECT_OBJECTIVES.md

## KTP Website: Project Objectives

This project delivers a secure, modern web presence for KTP Digital, built for easy management, analytics, and continual improvement.

### Core Goals:
- Provide a simple, maintainable, and secure PHP/Tailwind website
- Support rapid deployment and rollback using ZIP snapshots and Git
- Centralize all administration and analytics under `/admin`
- Log and visualize site usage for ongoing market segmentation and SEO optimization
- Ensure that objectives and change history are always visible and versioned
- Enable seamless future migration from `ww2.ktp.digital` to `www.ktp.digital` with no hardcoded subdomain logic
- Keep all navigation and assets relative or config-driven for environment portability

### Admin/Analytics Roadmap:
- Admin hub at `/admin/`
- Download any snapshot or log file from the admin panel
- Track pageviews, user agents, referers, and IPs for traffic analysis
- Show version and objectives history in a human-readable form
- Allow secure access (username+password, then later OIDC or SSO)
- Future: Expose key site settings and SEO controls to admin panel

---
### Remote Workflow Support:
- All project management, file editing, and admin must be fully operable via SSH and SCP from a Mac (or other remote system)
- No required steps may assume local desktop GUI access; everything must be executable from a remote shell/editor (vim/nano) or via secure file copy
- All code, admin tools, and setup steps must support headless remote operation (no manual web uploads or GUI installers)

#### [2025-05-21 15:53:31 AEST][v1.4.5-dev]
üîπ Project Structure & Workflow

Project root: /opt/webstack
Live site: https://www.ktp.digital
Admin: /admin/ (login: admin / Einstein88)
All code/dev is 100% remote (SSH/SFTP/vim/BBEdit), never local/GUI/manual.
No steps may require desktop or GUI access ‚Äî everything is CLI/terminal ready.
Production paths only: No staging, all work and deploys are live and versioned.
üîπ Versioning & Change History

Current version: v1.4.5-dev (tracked in /opt/webstack/html/VERSION)
Objectives & change history: Markdown files in /opt/webstack/objectives
‚Üí Viewable via /admin/changes.php (direct link)
All major admin tools (analytics, maintenance, file stats, objectives) are mobile-responsive, Tailwind-styled, and live in /admin/, using admin_auth.php and admin_nav.php for consistency and security.
üîπ DevOps & Automation

Bump script: /opt/webstack/bin/update_version.sh
Snapshots full site (ZIPs)
Backs up configs, Nginx, and SSL certs to /opt/webstack/config_backup
Clears logs on version bump
Syncs VERSION
Commits & pushes to GitHub (repo: jasonhollis/webstack)
Disaster recovery: All code, config, and SSL/cert material is versioned and snapshotted; logs and snapshots are not in git.
üîπ Admin Portal & Site Features

Maintenance: Download any snapshot or log file; pixel-perfect and mobile friendly.
Analytics: Traffic by date, user agent breakdown, referrers, top IPs, admin hits, with option to exclude your IP via URL flag.
File/objectives history: Browse, view, and download any objectives/changelog Markdown file via /admin/changes.php.
Each file shows clickable cards, full-content view, download, and timestamp.
All admin/dev tools: Use strict EOF file blocks for deploy/update.
All production assets, config, and objectives are git-tracked (except .gitignore exclusions: venv, logs, snapshots, node_modules, temp files).
üîπ Current & Next Priorities

Admin polish: Continue improving admin UX, navigation, and responsiveness.
Analytics enhancements: Deeper insights, better IP/referrer aggregation, maybe top countries or bots.
Workflow automation: More automation for objectives logging, deploys, or restores.
Objectives logging: Streamline and enhance logging from BBEdit/Automator, improve formatting and timestamping.
Disaster recovery: Keep SSL/config versioning bulletproof, ensure all backup steps are robust.
Security review: Hardening for admin, review password handling, future OIDC/SSO if required.
Config/cert versioning: Ensure every deploy has a matching backup of config and certs; maintain rollback clarity.
üîπ Ready for Any Task

You may now proceed with:

Any detailed admin, dev, or automation task.
EOF patches for any file (admin, analytics, workflow, recovery, objectives, etc.).
Documentation, scripting, config changes, or bugfixes.
Security reviews, DR/backup validation, or versioning improvements.
üü¢ Ready.
Reply with any objective, dev/admin task, or specific file to patch.
Full history and latest objectives loaded‚Äîcontinue at full velocity!

OK I have a function now that moves selected text on my Mac to objectives.md I want to 1. create another quick action call move clipboard to the objectives.md but I would really like to enhance the setup to be a more fully functional transaction log such that I can create another quick action that will move screen shots or other images somewhere on the server so that could be rolled up and included dynamically the way we are now with simple text

OK so I have a lot of stuff working I think "ssh root@ww2.ktp.digital '/opt/webstack/bin/append_objective.sh "$(cat)"' won't work with an image.  This is what's getting passed over right now I think you were correct the image action in the terminal needs to be and scp action to somewhere "/Users/jason/Library/Containers/at.EternalStorms.Yoink/Data/Documents/YoinkPromisedFiles.noIndex/yoinkFilePromiseCreationFolderE470A8DB-0E29-403D-8FF8-BCD52697ED19/addE470A8DB-0E29-403D-8FF8-BCD52697ED19/Screenshot 2025-05-21 at 16.33.05.png" is the filename that's being kicked out of our route right now and is in the objectives.md I think we have to pass that file name to scp to push it into a file or a routine to add the image to a page somehow?

KTP Webstack v1.4.5-dev ‚Äî Objectives & Changelog Summary

üß≠ Project Mission
Deliver a secure, modern, and maintainable PHP/Tailwind website for KTP Digital.
Centralize all admin/analytics under /admin.
Ensure all changes, objectives, and version history are always visible, markdown-logged, and accessible remotely.
Support fast, reliable, fully remote workflow (SSH/SFTP/vim/BBEdit) for all admin/dev tasks‚Äînever local/manual/GUI.
üöÄ Core Technical Milestones
All code, content, and admin workflows are version-controlled and tracked.
Deployment, rollback, and disaster recovery via Git, versioned objectives, and ZIP snapshots.
Admin pages and analytics are fully mobile-responsive, use Tailwind, and support download of any log/snapshot.
Site can migrate between subdomains (ww2 ‚Üí www) with no hardcoded logic.
üîí Security & Automation
Deployment now backs up Nginx configs and SSL certs on each version bump.
Logs are cleared on each deploy; snapshots are maintained for DR.
Strict .gitignore excludes venv, logs, node_modules, temp; all critical code/config is tracked.
Admin tools all require password and use unified navigation.
üìà Admin & Analytics Roadmap
Admin panel at /admin/ is the single point for analytics, file/objective logs, and snapshot downloads.
Objectives logging is markdown-based and can be appended via CLI, BBEdit, or Automator.
Analytics enhanced: traffic breakdown by date, user agent, referrer, IPs, and "admin hits" (with IP exclusion toggle).
üñºÔ∏è Image and Text Logging Evolution
Automator Quick Action enables instant appending of text or image references from Mac to objectives.md (or versioned objectives logs).
Text: sent as stdin using ssh ... '/opt/webstack/bin/append_objective.sh "$(cat)"'
Images: copied with scp, then server-side script (add_image_to_objectives.sh) appends Markdown image reference and version/timestamp to objectives.
PHP viewer /admin/changes.php now uses Parsedown for full Markdown rendering‚Äîimages, formatting, and code blocks now display beautifully.
Web-accessible symlink established for /admin/objectives/images ‚Üí /opt/webstack/objectives/images.
üîÅ Workflow Examples
Bump version:
/opt/webstack/bin/update_version.sh v1.4.5-dev
‚Üí Backs up configs/certs, clears logs, snapshots, commits, and pushes to Git.
Log text via Automator:
SSH with stdin to append_objective.sh.
Log image via Automator:
scp to images dir, then ssh to add_image_to_objectives.sh.
All entries in objectives are markdown and appear live in /admin/changes.php (with full image and formatting support).
üü¢ Current Priorities & Status
Everything now works on the correct www.ktp.digital domain.
Image logging, symlinks, and markdown parsing are fully functional.
Remote admin workflow is bulletproof, DR-ready, and production-controlled.
Ready for future expansion: captions for images, multi-file uploads, batch transaction logging, advanced analytics, and OIDC/SSO for admin.
You are live, versioned, and all major operational targets for v1.4.5-dev are locked in.

# v1.8.4 Iteration Log
*Version Start: Friday, August 8, 2025 - 21:52 Melbourne Time*

## <¯ Major Infrastructure Optimization

### Storage Crisis Discovered & Resolved
- **Problem**: 17GB of snapshots, 850MB per backup, 45-second snapshot times
- **Root Causes**:
  - 700MB of video files being backed up repeatedly
  - 3.2GB of failed temp files (zi*) from timeouts
  - 134MB of accumulated screenshots
  - 35,747 lines of log files tracked in git

### Performance Improvements Implemented

#### Snapshot Optimization
- **Before**: 888MB snapshots taking 45 seconds
- **After**: 105MB snapshots taking 5 seconds
- **Reduction**: 88% smaller, 90% faster
- Excluded: Video files (*.mp4, *.mov, *.webm), screenshots, PSD files

#### Update Script Enhancements
- Added automatic cleanup before snapshots
- Removes failed temp files (zi*)
- Cleans screenshots older than 7 days
- Cleans objectives/images older than 30 days
- Result: Self-maintaining system

#### Git Repository Cleanup
- Removed 82 log files from version control
- Deleted 35,747 lines of unnecessary tracked logs
- Updated .gitignore to properly exclude logs
- Future pushes will be significantly faster

### Technical Analysis

#### Hardware Assessment
- **Server**: 47GB RAM, 12 CPUs, 709GB disk (only 6% used)
- **Location**: Sydney, Australia (150-200ms latency to GitHub US)
- **Capacity**: 280+ years at optimized growth rate
- **Conclusion**: Massively overspecced, no need for second server

#### Storage Growth Projections
- **Before optimization**: 2GB/month growth
- **After optimization**: 200MB/month growth
- **Reduction**: 90% less storage consumption

### Database Migration Planning
Designed schema for transitioning from file-based to database logging:
- web_analytics table for visitor tracking
- version_history for deployment audit trail
- operation_logs for system monitoring
- Benefits: Better querying, automatic rotation, smaller footprint

### Key Discoveries
1. Git push timeouts were due to pushing massive log files
2. Sydney to US latency compounds with large git operations
3. Shell scripts need timeouts on all network operations
4. Snapshot script was including unnecessary files
5. Log files should never be in version control

### Lessons Learned
- Always exclude logs from git tracking
- Video/media files shouldn't be in every backup
- Network latency from Australia requires longer timeouts
- Regular cleanup prevents accumulation issues
- Monitor snapshot sizes to catch bloat early

## Session Summary
Transformed a failing, bloated system into a lean, self-maintaining infrastructure. Version bumps now take 10 seconds instead of minutes, snapshots are 88% smaller, and the system automatically cleans up after itself. Ready for sustainable long-term operation.

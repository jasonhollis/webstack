## KTP Webstack — v1.5.6-dev-content Release Summary

### Focus
Content workflow overhaul, full git integration, and robust versioning for all site code and assets.

---

### Key Changes & Accomplishments

- **Cloned full repo locally for BBEdit-based editing**  
  Enabled safe, tracked, and efficient content and code editing with instant rollback and version history.

- **Enabled complete Git versioning and sync**  
    - Fixed `.gitignore` issues that previously blocked tracking of all critical site files.
    - Removed the over-broad ignore rule (`*`) from `/opt/webstack/html/.gitignore`.
    - Ensured no project-level `.gitignore` rules were excluding site files.
    - Added/committed all HTML, PHP, asset, and admin files into version control.
    - Pushed all changes to GitHub for safe, offsite backup and collaboration.

- **Verified two-way workflow**  
    - Local (Mac) and server can both push/pull, making edits, rollbacks, and deployment seamless.

- **Git-powered workflow standardized**  
    - All future changes (content or code) are instantly tracked.
    - Rollback, compare, audit, and deploy features are available at every step.

### Benefits Realized

- **Instant rollback** on any file, any time—no more risk of losing changes or overwriting critical files.
- **Clear release checkpoints** and history for every code/content update.
- **Streamlined collaboration** and easy handoff between Mac and server.
- **Eliminated manual .bak scripts**—version control now protects everything.
- **Ready for clean, reliable content improvements and expansion.**

---

### Next Steps

- Continue content polish and SEO/meta tag upgrades in a fully versioned environment.
- Push/pull regularly to keep Mac and server in sync.
- Use `update_version.sh` after each major release milestone for log/snapshot/versioning continuity.

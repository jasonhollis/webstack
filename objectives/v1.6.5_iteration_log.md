🚀 Key Changes

Light Theme and Layout Overhaul:
All main pages (index, stories, automation) now use a consistent, approachable light theme—no dark mode or backdrops—boosting readability and appeal for all audiences.
Landing Page Redesign:
Immediate value prop: “What Are You Trying to Fix?” section now leads with customer pain points, not features.
Responsive, icon-driven solution cards link directly to service pages.
Hero sections and headings use accessible font weights and sizes.
Home Automation Stories (ha-stories.php):
Three customer stories showcased, each with a Home Assistant-style light bulb icon.
Font size and line spacing increased for maximum readability.
Stories highlight real-life transformation—covering legacy integration, large property automation, and total platform migration.
Responsive 3-column layout on desktop, stacking on mobile/tablet.
Refactored layout.php:
Accepts simple, modular $content blocks—no array or dark mode logic.
Footer and nav unified site-wide.
All headings/text colors fixed for light background.
All SVG icons and CTA logic reviewed and updated:
No more broken icons.
Used inline SVG for Home Assistant light bulb (consistent with HA UI).
Ensured all icons have matching alt text and class for responsive sizing.
Index and all service pages made fully consistent:
Fixed white text on white background in legacy card layouts.
Added max-width containers and padding to maintain visual alignment.

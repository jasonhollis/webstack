Resume KTP Webstack development from v1.5.8-dev-backlog. Last release (v1.5.7-dev-roadmap) added a markdown-driven admin Roadmap tab, unified navigation styling, and bugfixes. Roadmap.md is now the project planning hub. Focus for this release: clearing my “mental backlog,” implementing or documenting all those recurring pain points, TODOs, and “must fix/finish” items I’ve been thinking about but haven’t logged formally.

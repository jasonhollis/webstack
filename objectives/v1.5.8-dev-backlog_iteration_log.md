Release Summary for v1.5.8-dev-backlog

Release: v1.5.8-dev-backlog
Date: 2025-05-24

Key Changes & Achievements:
Meta Tag & SEO Audit Modernized:
The Meta Tag & SEO Coverage section in system_meta.php now checks the live rendered HTML of all public-facing pages. This upgrade eliminates false negatives, ensuring true site health and compliance.
SEO Hygiene Remediation:
Added missing meta descriptions for index.php and smallbiz.php.
Confirmed that all other public pages are SEO-compliant and correctly reporting in the dashboard.
Process and Policy Hardened:
Updated PROJECT_DIRECTIVES.md with the new “Review Before Replacement” rule, mandating that all EOF replacements must review the current file or page first, preserving all original logic and structure.
Backlog Process Started:
Seeded a backlog.md for recurring pain points and future punchlist items, including:
Humanizing memory reporting in the dashboard
Clarifying the SSL/TLS block
Building a proper admin backlog page for ongoing mental clutter/tasks
Admin UI & System Meta Integrity:
All dashboard sections remain unified and visually consistent; no workflow disruptions.

Resume KTP Webstack development from v1.5.8-dev-backlog. Last release (v1.5.7-dev-roadmap) added a markdown-driven admin Roadmap tab, unified navigation styling, and bugfixes. Roadmap.md is now the project planning hub. Focus for this release: clearing my “mental backlog,” implementing or documenting all those recurring pain points, TODOs, and “must fix/finish” items I’ve been thinking about but haven’t logged formally.

We need a backlog.  I'm not asking to build it now.  The memory section makes no sense to a human and the TLS and security bit is wrong but you have fixed the objective.  I'm going blind with this minutia .... seems like index.php is the only issues but that's probably big

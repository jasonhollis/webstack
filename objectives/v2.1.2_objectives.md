# v2.1.2 Objectives
*Version Focus: Database Logging Migration - Phase 1*

## Primary Goals
Continue the v2.1.x series focus on migrating from file-based logging to database-driven logging system. Phase 1 involves implementing parallel logging (both file and database) to ensure no data loss during transition.

## Tasks

### 1. Parallel Logging Implementation
- [ ] Add DatabaseLogger to update_version.py with dual logging
- [ ] Add DatabaseLogger to failure.py with dual logging  
- [ ] Add DatabaseLogger to snapshot_webstack.py with dual logging
- [ ] Keep existing file logs as backup during transition
- [ ] Test all operations with both logging systems active

### 2. Database Health Monitoring
- [ ] Create database connection health check
- [ ] Implement automatic reconnection on failure
- [ ] Add connection pooling for better performance
- [ ] Monitor query performance metrics

### 3. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test version bump with dual logging
- [ ] Test snapshot creation with dual logging
- [ ] Test failure notifications with dual logging
- [ ] Verify no log entries are lost
- [ ] Compare file vs database logs for completeness

### 4. Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with dual logging architecture
- [ ] Document fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Create migration timeline documentation

## Success Criteria
- All three Python scripts successfully log to both file and database
- Zero log entries lost during operations
- Database logging gracefully falls back to file-only on connection issues
- Performance impact < 100ms per operation
- All existing functionality preserved

## Notes
- This is Phase 1 of a 5-phase migration plan
- File logging will be maintained for at least 2 weeks of parallel operation
- Focus on reliability over performance optimization in this phase
- Emergency.log will be implemented in Phase 2

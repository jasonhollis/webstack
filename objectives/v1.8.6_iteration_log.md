## ðŸ”§ Admin System Fixes and Enhancements

### Critical Bug Fixes

#### 1. Fixed system_meta.php Page
**Problem Identified:**
- Admin system_meta.php page reported as broken
- PHP session warnings: "session_start(): Ignoring session_start() because a session is already active"
- Duplicate session initialization causing notices in error logs

**Solution Implemented:**
- Modified `/opt/webstack/html/admin/admin_auth.php` to check session status before starting
- Added conditional: `if (session_status() === PHP_SESSION_NONE) { session_start(); }`
- Eliminated duplicate session warnings across all admin pages

**Result:**
- âœ… system_meta.php fully functional
- âœ… No more session warnings in error logs
- âœ… Clean PHP execution without notices

#### 2. Screenshot Upload Permission Fix
**Problem Identified:**
- Upload functionality broken with "Permission denied" errors
- PHP process (www-data) couldn't write to `/opt/webstack/screenshots/`
- Directory owned by root:root instead of www-data

**Solution Implemented:**
```bash
chown -R www-data:www-data /opt/webstack/screenshots
chmod 755 /opt/webstack/screenshots
```

**Result:**
- âœ… Upload functionality restored
- âœ… Files successfully uploading with proper permissions
- âœ… Verified with test upload: screenshot-20250810-122827-0.png (5.4MB)

### UI/UX Improvements

#### Screenshot Upload Integration
**Enhancement:**
- Added "Screenshots" link to admin navigation header

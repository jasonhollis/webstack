KTP Webstack v1.6.2-dev — Release Summary

Release Date: 2025-05-26
Tagline: Polished, unified, and future-proof — every card delivers, every page shines.

What’s New & Improved
Homepage (index.php) Revamp:
Promoted new, visually unified homepage—no more dead links, all cards link to live landing pages.
Cards grouped and centered for clear navigation and high conversion.
All icons standardized (Lucide SVGs or official brand SVGs), with forced-white or monochrome for total visual harmony.
Full Service Landing Page Coverage:
Every “What Are You Trying to Fix?” card now has a dedicated landing page (network, security, email, integration, websites, cloud, etc.).
Each service page is SEO-optimized, mobile-friendly, and directly actionable (clear copy, bold CTA, professional icons).
Automated SEO/Meta Dashboard:
SEO/meta tag coverage is now fully dynamic and self-healing—new PHP pages are instantly included, old/system files auto-excluded.
Visual “green/yellow/red” coverage dashboard for instant compliance checks.
Sitemap & Robots.txt Polished:
Sitemap updated to include all public pages, with clean URLs.
Robots.txt locked down to exclude admin, backups, scripts, system files, and dev/test content.
File Hygiene, Snapshots, and Rollback:
Atomic promotion of new index, backup of prior, permissions enforced, and all changes tracked in git.
Clean, versioned git log for total traceability and instant rollback.
UI Consistency:
Footer, admin, and meta dashboards match site branding.
All visual spacing, grid alignment, and iconography are now locked in and easy to iterate.
Why This Is the Smoothest Release Yet
No manual cleanup or catch-up—every public-facing asset is up to date and compliant.
Zero dead-end pages—every card delivers value and action.
All system and meta reporting are self-updating (no stale config, no extra admin).
Git and snapshot workflows allow fearless, rapid iteration.
Instant rollback with one file move, just in case.

#### [2025-05-26 09:06:40 AEST][v1.6.2-dev]
Resume KTP Webstack dev from v1.6.1-dev.

All homepage/service card icons standardized: Lucide SVGs for generic categories, official SVGs for brands (Apple, QNAP, Ubiquiti, Home Assistant).  

Home Assistant icon is now a canonical SVG (home-assistant.svg), forced-white/monochrome branding enforced where needed.  

Grid spacing, icon sizing, and placement are visually unified—no PNGs or mismatched icon styles remain.  

Tested and rolled back modern “glass” card polish via sed one-liner; confirmed safe atomic rollback and snapshot restore with preserved `new_index.php`.  

Snapshot-based file hygiene, permission fix (`chmod 644`), and workflow validated—restoration and iteration now low-risk.  

**Priority:** Rapid landing page/service subpage improvements, with the same icon/branding polish, meta/SEO tune-up, and iterative deployment (EOF or one-liner only, no manual multi-step edits).

Pick up with service landing page branding or card polish next.

**Release v1.7.2 Summary**

* **New & Fixed Icons**

  * Added icons for:

    * Amazon Alexa
    * IKEA TRÅDFRI
    * Shelly
    * SmartThings
    * HomeKit Bridge (now uses same icon as HomeKit Device)
    * Porsche Connect
    * Sony Bravia TV
    * Zigbee2MQTT
  * Removed fallback to generic “Home Assistant” graphic for those integrations.

* **Alphabetical Ordering**

  * Injected a `usort()` on `$ha_integrations` so the grid renders in case-insensitive alphabetical order by **name**.

* **Fetch Scripts Overhaul**

  * **`fetch_ha_icons.sh`**

    * Reads from `ha_integrations.json`, applies `brand_map` overrides, attempts SVG then PNG from `brands.home-assistant.io`, special-cases Zigbee2MQTT to fetch from its repo.
    * Logs via `tee` and funnels errors through `failure.sh` for Pushover alerts.
  * **`fetch_extra_icons.sh`**

    * Grabs “custom\_integrations” logos for Sony Bravia TV and Zigbee2MQTT when missing.
    * Skips download if icon’s already present.
  * Both scripts are now cron-ready and idempotent.

* **Cron Jobs**

  * Scheduled daily at **03:00** → `fetch_extra_icons.sh`
  * At **03:05** → `fetch_ha_icons.sh`
  * Logs consolidated to `/opt/webstack/logs/ha_icon_cron.log`

* **Deployment Workflow**

  * `update_version.sh` now snapshots **prior** version before committing/tagging the bump.
  * Old debug dumps removed from `landing.php` and CI-style logs preserved.

Everything’s pushed, tagged v1.7.2, and old logs/snapshots archived. Let me know if you’d like to roll anything back or run further verification!

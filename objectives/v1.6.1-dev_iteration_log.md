KTP Webstack v1.6.1-dev — Release Summary (2025-05-25)
Highlights & Completed Actions

Service Card Icon Overhaul
All homepage/service cards now use SVG icons (Lucide for generic, official for brands).
Home Assistant SVG extracted, standardized, and used for all “Smart Home & Office”/SOHO branding.
Ubiquiti, Apple, and QNAP logos standardized to monochrome or forced-white for clarity.
Visual Consistency & Quality
Card grid fully aligned:
Icon size, padding, and placement unified.
No PNG or mismatched icon styles remain.
Resolved all missing/broken icon issues with correct SVGs and permissions (chmod 644).
Polished card grid with a one-liner (sed) for modernized, glassy, and interactive card appearance—then rolled back for style review and stability.
Safe Rollback and Version Control
Used safe sed one-liners for visual changes and validated rollback workflow.
Snapshots leveraged for full file restoration, with atomic move/restore commands to protect WIP.
Documented and tested “restore from snapshot” procedures for future rapid rollbacks.
File Hygiene & Best Practices
Ensured world-readable permissions for all icon SVGs.
File and directory structure double-checked—no case sensitivity or missing assets.
Process/Workflow

All changes as full EOF replacements or safe one-liners (no multi-line patching).
Quick test/rollback cycle enabled seamless, low-risk visual iteration.
All experimental versions retained (new_index.php preserved alongside live version).
Release Impact

Homepage/service cards are visually unified, professional, and fully branded.
All icons render reliably and crisply on all devices/dark modes.
Rapid restoration and experimentation processes validated—future changes are low risk.
Next Steps / Suggestions
If further visual polish is needed, iterate on card hover/gradient or landing pages.
Continue this workflow for landing/service subpages: icon, branding, SEO meta polish.
Leverage snapshot/restore for any high-velocity experimentation.

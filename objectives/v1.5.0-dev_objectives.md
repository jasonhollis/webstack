I think we should add the All failures routed via failure.sh and logged/alerted per directives bit into the project directives

Let's start with the nav bar.  It does not run across the whole page on any of the pages at this point notice the space in the upper left

3\. Audit and Correction Approach

  * Step 1: Check the <script src="...tailwindcss.com"> on all main pages (index.php, about.php, etc.) and set to 3.4.1 everywhere.
  * Step 2: Re-audit your most recent layouts for any non-3.x classes (e.g., bg-black/90 is supported, but others may not be).
  * Step 3: If you encounter visual glitches, colors not applying, spacing issues, or dark mode not working—it's likely a class or CDN version mismatch.

FileWhat it DoesNav Impact

layout.php
Site-wide layout
Includes nav.php at top, sets page padding, renders page content, handles background & footer

nav.php
Navigation bar
Stretches full width, fixed at top, mobile/desktop

*.php
Content pages
Call renderLayout(), supply unique content

We have one major fix left for this release.  I want images to render and link like you have working in /admin/logs.php but I'm also pasting php revision code into the log and that is being rendered instead of being protected e.g. the browser is trying to interpret it all.  What can be done to fix this?

# v2.1.0 Iteration Log
*Session: Wednesday, August 14, 2025*

## Session Overview
Major enhancement of premium landing pages with comprehensive lead capture forms, Australian postcode/suburb lookup, and email notification system. Removed geographic limitations to serve all of Melbourne and Victoria while maintaining premium positioning.

## Major Achievements

### 1. Universal Service Area Expansion
**Removed Suburb Restrictions:**
- Changed from exclusive suburbs (Toorak, Brighton, etc.) to all Melbourne/Victoria
- Updated messaging: "Exclusively serving" → "Proudly serving all areas"
- Maintained premium positioning without geographic limitations
- Updated both spiral and light landing page versions

### 2. Comprehensive Lead Capture Forms
**Upgraded from simple 5-field form to detailed 12-field system:**
- **Personal Details**: First name and surname (separate fields)
- **Contact**: Email and phone with Australian format validation (0400 000 000)
- **Location**: Open suburb field + 4-digit postcode (no restrictions)
- **Project Type**: Updates/New System/New Build dropdown
- **Integrations**: Multi-select for 8 areas (Lighting, Climate, Security, etc.)
- **Property Details**: Type, bedrooms, other rooms
- **Budget**: Realistic ranges ($5K to $75K+)
- **Additional Details**: Optional textarea for specifics

### 3. Australian Postcode/Suburb Lookup System
**Created `/api/postcode_lookup.php`:**
- Primary API: postcodeapi.com.au (free, 100 req/hour)
- Fallback: Static database of 50+ Victorian postcodes
- Returns suburb, state, latitude/longitude
- Supports lookup by postcode OR suburb name
- JSON response format with error handling

**JavaScript Autocomplete (`/js/postcode_autocomplete.js`):**
- Real-time suburb suggestions as user types
- Auto-fills postcode when suburb selected
- Auto-fills suburb(s) when 4-digit postcode entered
- Dropdown UI for multiple suburbs per postcode
- Debounced API calls (300ms) to prevent overload
- Clean dropdown interface with hover effects

### 4. Email Notification System Implementation
**Added PHPMailer integration to both landing pages:**
- Sends to leads@ktp.digital via Mailgun SMTP
- Subject: `[Home Automation] New Lead - {Type} [{Name}]`
- Includes all form data and calculated lead score
- Fallback file logging to `/opt/webstack/logs/leads.log`
- Graceful error handling (saves to DB even if email fails)
- Tested and confirmed working (17:53 test email delivered)

### 5. Enhanced Lead Scoring Algorithm
**Intelligent scoring based on multiple factors:**
- Base score: 50 points
- Budget scoring: +10 to +25 points based on range
- Integration scoring: +5 points per selected area
- Example: $35-75K budget + 4 integrations = 95 score
- Stored in `premium_leads.lead_score` column

### 6. Database Schema Updates
**Added to `premium_leads` table:**
- `postcode` column for better geographic tracking
- `project_type` properly captured
- `message` field contains full project details
- Lead scores for prioritization

## Technical Improvements

### API Integration
- Implemented postcodeapi.com.au integration
- Built fallback system for reliability
- Added request logging for monitoring
- Rate limiting protection via debouncing

### Form Processing
- Full form validation with patterns
- Proper data sanitization
- PDO prepared statements for security
- Transaction-safe database operations

### User Experience

## Major Achievements

### 1. System Memory Optimization
**Resolved 1GB memory leak from unnecessary service:**

- Killed process and permanently disabled/masked service
- Freed up 1GB of system memory

### 2. Landing Page Content Improvements
**Fixed awkward wording on premium landing pages:**
- Changed "REQUEST AN INVITATION" to "SCHEDULE YOUR CONSULTATION"
- Applied to both `premium-landing-spiral.php` and `premium-landing-spiral-test.php`
- More professional and action-oriented call-to-action

### 3. Integration Showcase System
**Created proper integration category pages:**
- Built new `/integrations.php` with category filtering
- Categories: Garage & Gates, Facial Recognition, License Plates, Climate Control, Smart Lighting
- Dynamic integration display based on category selection
- Category navigation with active state highlighting
- Call-to-action section linking back to consultation form

### 4. Fixed Broken Links

- Footer links also updated for consistency

### 5. Home Assistant Integration Enhancement
**Expanded integration system with comprehensive brand coverage:**
- Added 26 major integrations to ha_integrations.json

- Successfully fetched 50+ icons from brands.home-assistant.io
- Icons include Ring, Nest, Spotify, Plex, Roku, Ecobee, August, etc.
- System now visually mirrors Home Assistant's integration page

### 6. Icon Fetcher Python Migration
**Converted bash script to Python with enhanced features:**

## Technical Details

### Memory Issue Resolution

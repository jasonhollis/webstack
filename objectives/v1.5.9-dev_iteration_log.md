KTP Webstack v1.5.9-dev — System Meta & Security Diagnostics Upgrade

Major Changes Delivered
TLS/SSL Certificate Reporting is Now Fully Live
Dashboard reads and parses actual Let’s Encrypt cert file (/etc/letsencrypt/archive/ww2.ktp.digital/fullchain2.pem) for bulletproof reliability.
Accurately reports all domains covered by the certificate and precise expiry date and countdown (green if valid, red if expired).
Survives symlink and PHP user permission edge cases, with robust group and directory fixes.
Firewall Status Block is 100% Accurate and Automated
Uses sudo /usr/sbin/ufw status (with safe sudoers rule) to let PHP (www-data) read live UFW firewall state.
Displays status as ACTIVE or INACTIVE, plus all open TCP/UDP ports (IPv4 and IPv6).
Secure implementation: www-data can only read status, not change rules.
Human-Readable, Contextual Memory Stats
RAM stats now show in GB/MB with tooltips explaining each field (Total, Used, Free, Shared, Buffers/Cache, Available) for clarity.
SEO/Meta Coverage Audit Enhanced
Now highlights “too short” pages (under 200 words) in yellow.
Error rows are red, compliant are green—real-time, live-fetched, and human-friendly.
File and Directory Permissions Hardened
All required Certbot and UFW dirs/files now have correct group and read/traverse permissions for PHP (www-data), balancing automation and security.
All Debug, Cert, and Firewall Edge Cases Resolved
Debug files validated; all permission, path, and environment issues systematically traced and solved.
Security and Reliability Notes
Sudoers entry is tight: only allows status, not changes.
No dangerous shell execs or world-write permission changes.
Certbot renewals and UFW config changes will “just work” for future automation.
Admin/Dev Notes
Debug/test PHP scripts can be safely removed from /admin.
No leftover permission hacks or symlink workarounds—root cause solved.
Meta dashboard is now the single source of truth for site health and SEO.

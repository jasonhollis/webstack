If your Automator/Quick Action is set to “Service receives selected text,”
you can highlight any text in any app and right-click → “Log Activity to Webstack”.
Or, you can just invoke it and pass a quoted argument.

How to Debug:

SSH to your server and check for content:
cat /opt/webstack/objectives/v1.4.6-dev_iteration_log.md
If it’s empty: add an entry from your Mac or manually.
If it exists and is non-empty, check file permissions (should be readable by the web server).
Try selecting an older version from the dropdown (if available) to see if any previous logs are displayed.
If you see only an empty box even when the log is non-empty:
There may be a bug in the PHP echo/nl2br/htmlspecialchars logic.

You used to have the cool home logo (much bigger) for back to site and logout used to be red.  Obviously the nav bar is getting crammed.  I don't think you need the legacy iteration logs.  What do you recommend to clean this up?

**Debugging:******

  * If you see **RAW: ** in the log and it’s still empty, the problem is in Shortcuts' data flow, not the server script.
  * To confirm: run /opt/webstack/bin/append_activity.sh manually and type some text, press Ctrl-D. If it logs correctly, the script is fine.

  


Summary:

  * Make sure the input is piped to stdin.
  * Call your script without arguments in SSH step.
  * Your server script is correct as written above.

How to Combine Text and Image Logging with One Shortcut + One Server Script

**1\. Unified macOS Shortcut Logic******

  * Branch logic in the Shortcut:
    * If input is text (rich text or Markdown): SSH to the server and call /opt/webstack/bin/append_activity.sh with the text via stdin.
    * If input is a file/image:
      * SCP the file to /opt/webstack/objectives/images/
      * Then SSH to the server and call /opt/webstack/bin/append_activity.sh with a Markdown reference to the image, e.g.:


---
#### [2025-05-22 14:45:26][v1.4.6-dev]
**2\. Unified Server Script (**append_activity.sh**)******

  * Accepts stdin (text/Markdown, including image references).
  * Logs as before to quickactions.log and the versioned iteration log.
  * No changes needed—it doesn’t care if the input is text, Markdown, or an image reference.


---
#### [2025-05-22 14:45:50][v1.4.6-dev]
Benefits

  * One script handles everything.
  * All inputs are logged, notified, and versioned consistently.
  * Easy to extend for future actions (audio, video, etc.).


---
#### [2025-05-22 14:47:32][v1.4.6-dev]
Exactly right! In Apple Shortcuts, you can use an If action to branch based on the type of input received (“Shortcut Input”):

  * If input is text (or rich text):
    * Convert to Markdown (if needed)
    * Pass to SSH as stdin (call /opt/webstack/bin/append_activity.sh)
  * If input is a file/image:
    * Use Get Details of Files to check type
    * SCP the file to server
    * Then SSH and call /opt/webstack/bin/append_activity.sh with a Markdown image reference


---
#### [2025-05-22 14:47:44][v1.4.6-dev]
Step-by-Step: Apple Shortcut Logic

**1\. Receive Anything******

  * Receive [Anything] from [Share Sheet, Quick Actions]

  


**2\. If Input is File******

  * If [Shortcut Input] [is] [a File]
    * Get the name of the file:
      * Get Name of [Shortcut Input]
      * Replace spaces in name (with -)
    * Upload (SCP) the file:
      * Use Run Shell Script


---
#### [2025-05-22 14:47:59][v1.4.6-dev]
scp "$SHORTCUT_INPUT" root@www.ktp.digital:/opt/webstack/objectives/images/"$FILENAME"


---
#### [2025-05-22 14:48:26][v1.4.6-dev]
    * Compose Markdown reference:
      * ![](/admin/objectives/images/$FILENAME)
    * Run Script over SSH:
      * /opt/webstack/bin/append_activity.sh '![](/admin/objectives/images/$FILENAME)'
  * Otherwise (Input is Text):
    * (Convert to Markdown from Rich Text, if needed)
    * Run Script over SSH (pass text as stdin to /opt/webstack/bin/append_activity.sh)

  


Apple Shortcuts Pseudocode

  1. If [Input is File]
    * Get Name/Extension
    * Run Shell Script (SCP file to server)
    * Set Markdown = ![](/admin/objectives/images/filename.png)
    * Run Script over SSH (append_activity.sh "$MARKDOWN")
  2. Otherwise
    * Convert to Markdown if Rich Text
    * Run Script over SSH (append_activity.sh with text as stdin)

  


How To Build This in Shortcuts:

Actions in Order:

  1. Receive [Anything] from [Share Sheet, Quick Actions]
  2. If [Shortcut Input] [is] [File]
    * Get Name of [Shortcut Input]
    * Replace Text (spaces with -)
    * Run Shell Script (scp to server)
    * Text: ![](/admin/objectives/images/filename.png)
    * Run Script over SSH (send that text)
  3. Otherwise
    * (Optional) Make Markdown from Rich Text
    * Run Script over SSH (send text as stdin)

  


---
#### [2025-05-22 14:54:30][v1.4.6-dev]
Absolutely—here’s how to build a unified Mac Shortcut to send either text (as Markdown) or files (images, etc) to the correct handler script on your server, using native “If” logic:

  


**A to Log/Objective – Universal Quick Action Shortcut (Text + File/Image)******

**1\. Shortcut Input******

  * Receive: Images and 18 more input from Share Sheet, Quick Actions
  * If there's no input: Get Clipboard (optional)

**2\. If Input is a File or Image******

  * If: Shortcut Input Type is File (or Image, see next note)
    * Then:
      * Set Variable: FILENAME = Name of Shortcut Input (removes spaces with a “Replace” if you want)

#### [2025-05-22 17:04:11][v1.4.6-dev]
What does this mean for your shortcut?

If branch for image/file:

  * Use Run Script over SSH
  * Input: Shortcut Input (Type: File or Image)
  * The script above

If branch for text:

  * Use Run Script over SSH
  * Input: Markdown from Rich Text (as before)
  * The script for text logging

  


Visual Steps

  1. If [Shortcut Input] Type is Image (or File) → Run Script over SSH for file upload
    * Input: Shortcut Input
    * Script as above
  2. Otherwise → Run Script over SSH for text
    * Input: Markdown from Rich Text
    * Script as before

  


What to do for this screen:

  * For image/file branch, you want:
    * Input: Shortcut Input (no transformation)
    * Script: use $1 as the image/file path
  * For text branch, you want:
    * Input: Markdown from Rich Text (transformed to plain text)
    * Script: read from stdin (cat - or $*)

  


Apple bug/limitation recap:

  * "Run Script over SSH" passes files as arguments, not stdin.
  * Text can be sent as stdin, but files are always as $1.

So you must design your script to accept a file path as $1 and not try to read image data from stdin!

  


Next Steps:

  1. Finish "If" to check if Shortcut Input is image/file.
  2. In "If True" branch:
    * Run Script over SSH, Input: Shortcut Input, Script uses $1 for image path, as above.
  3. In "Otherwise" branch:
    * Run Script over SSH, Input: Markdown from Rich Text, Script reads stdin (cat -).

RESUME: KTP Webstack Mac Shortcuts Automation, Image Logging, SSH Workflow

  


\- CONTEXT: This is the Jason Hollis KTP Digital webstack project (current version v1.4.6-dev+). We’re automating logging and image uploads to the server using macOS Shortcuts with “Run Script over SSH”. I want to be able to select text or images on the Mac, send to the server, and have them logged in Markdown via shell scripts.

\- RULES:

  1. **Never suggest multi-part file edits**. All script or code changes must be delivered as full EOF file replacements (with correct permissions), or a single sed/awk command if tiny patching is needed.

  2. **No rambling or step summaries** unless I explicitly ask for troubleshooting or an explanation. When I request a file or code, provide it immediately as a full replacement.

  3. All scripts must support stdin-only execution when invoked via SSH from macOS Shortcuts. No local shell arguments or assumptions about environment.

  4. When I upload screenshots of Shortcuts or scripts, analyze and suggest **only what’s required** for correct server-side or automation behavior.

  5. Default answer format: “Here is your full file/script/command”, nothing extra. Only explain if I ask “why” or “how.”

\- WORKFLOW: All logging, uploads, or Markdown processing on the server should use full file replacements, never incremental edits. 

\- CURRENT FOCUS: Troubleshooting/optimizing the Mac-to-server shortcut to:

  \- Upload images from Mac Shortcuts to the correct server directory

  \- Log image uploads in iteration logs using correct Markdown and relative paths

  \- Ensure filename sanitization and correct permissions

\- REMIND ME: All future tasks are expected to be delivered in deploy-ready, copy/paste EOF blocks or sed one-liners, with zero waffle.

RESUME: KTP Webstack Image Logging Automation, v1.4.7-dev+

  * CONTEXT: Automating Markdown logging and image uploads from macOS Shortcuts to the server via SSH and SCP.
  * Server scripts use full EOF replacements, stdin-only invocation, and strictly match file names (dashes for spaces).
  * All failures are routed through /opt/webstack/bin/failure.sh, which sends Pushover alerts and logs details.
  * Logging, uploads, and all shell scripts must remain deploy-ready with zero incremental edits or partial patches.
  * NO onboarding, NO explanations, just deliver the full script, command, or block exactly as specified.

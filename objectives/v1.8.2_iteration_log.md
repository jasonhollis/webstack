# v1.8.2 Iteration Log
*Version Start: Friday, August 8, 2025 - 19:15 Melbourne Time*

## ðŸ“… Day 1 - Friday, August 8, 2025 (Evening)

### ðŸ”€ Git Branch Consolidation

#### The Situation
- Discovered we'd been working on `pre-automation-backup-20250726-161216` branch for 2 weeks
- This branch was created July 26th as a backup before automation work
- Branch was never pushed to GitHub (local only)
- All v1.8.0 and v1.8.1 work was on this branch
- Master was still at v1.7.5

#### The Solution
1. Fixed update_version.sh to handle branches without upstream
   - Changed hard failures to warnings for git push operations
   - Script now continues locally even if push fails
   
2. Merged everything back to master
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git merge pre-automation-backup-20250726-161216  # Fast-forward merge
   git branch -d pre-automation-backup-20250726-161216  # Cleanup
   ```

3. Result: Clean master branch with all recent work

### ðŸ“Š What Got Merged
- 95 files changed
- 21,546 insertions
- 12,351 deletions
- Key additions:
  - CLAUDE.md documentation
  - Premium landing page system
  - Screenshot upload workflow
  - Automation API structure
  - Client portal foundation
  - Fixed layout system
  - All spiral video assets
  - v1.8.0 and v1.8.1 objectives/logs

### ðŸŽ¯ Final State
- Master branch: v1.8.1 (current)
- All work consolidated
- Old backup branch deleted
- Git history clean
- Ready for v1.8.2 bump

### ðŸ’¡ Lessons Learned
- Simple workflows are best
- Local branches are fine for solo development
- The existing snapshot system provides real safety
- Git is just for history, not complexity

## ðŸ”§ Pushover Notification Fixes

### Issue Identified
- update_version.sh was timing out at the end
- notify_pushover.sh was hanging indefinitely
- No timeout protection on curl commands

### Root Cause
1. notify_pushover.sh expected (title, message) but was being called with just message
2. No connection timeouts on curl commands
3. Network issues could cause indefinite hangs

### Fixes Applied

#### update_version.sh
- Added 5-second timeout wrapper around notify_pushover.sh call
- Fixed argument order: now passes both title and message
- Made notification failure non-blocking with `|| true`

#### notify_pushover.sh
- Added `--connect-timeout 5` to curl
- Added `--max-time 10` to curl
- Changed default title from "DNS Check" to "Webstack Notification"
- Added `|| true` to prevent script failure on network issues

#### failure.sh
- Added same timeout parameters for consistency
- Added `|| true` to prevent blocking on network failure
- Ensures failure logging continues even if Pushover is down

### Testing
- Tested notify_pushover.sh manually - completes in <1 second
- No more hanging processes
- Graceful degradation if Pushover is unreachable

# v1.8.1 Iteration Log
*Version Start: Friday, August 8, 2025 - 18:50 Melbourne Time*

## 📅 Day 1 - Friday, August 8, 2025 (Evening)

### 🔧 Version Control Fixes

#### Issue Resolution from v1.8.0
- Fixed VERSION file that remained at v1.7.5 after failed push
- Manually created v1.8.0 git tag that was skipped
- Documented the failure mode of update_version.sh script
- Learned that script fails safely - no partial updates

#### Understanding update_version.sh
The script's workflow (in order):
1. Snapshot old version
2. Git add & commit
3. Git push (FAILED HERE due to no upstream)
4. Reload PHP-FPM
5. Create git tag
6. Push tag
7. Update VERSION file
8. Create iteration/objective files

Because it failed at step 3, steps 4-8 never executed, leaving VERSION at v1.7.5.

### 📝 Documentation Updates
- Added version bump issue analysis to v1.8.0 iteration log
- Created proper fix documentation for future reference
- Established v1.8.1 as patch release to clean up

### 🎯 Current State
- VERSION file: v1.8.0 (manually corrected)
- Git tag: v1.8.0 (manually created)
- Premium landing page: Fully operational at /premium-landing.php
- All duplicate files: Cleaned up
- CLAUDE.md: Updated with "edit in place" workflow

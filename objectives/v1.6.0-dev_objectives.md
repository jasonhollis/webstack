  * Rewrite main pages for maximum clarity, SEO, and “why KTP?” storytelling.
  * [ ] Add /macos-tools.php and /automation.php case studies for Home Assistant and real client work.

We need to really Enhance Small Biz and it needs to link to Mac Mac-Os tools, Nas, NextDNS and Tailscale. We used to say a lot about Ubiquiti and that's all gone at the moment?  We probably need a seperate page on Ubiquiti and the them of NextDNS and Tailscale need to be updated

We should probably grab the icons or logos for everything as well.  With the new Ubiquiti page It's not dream machine pro there should be a section on Cloud gateways, networking and WIFI7 with a link, Security Cameras with infasys on AI cams and maybe integration with NAS and another section on Access Controls with a blurb on License plate and facial recognition

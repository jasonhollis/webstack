üìã **Next Objectives for KTP Webstack (Post-bump)******

  1. Unify Logging Routines
    * Standardize _all_ append/logging scripts (activity, objective, iteration, image handlers) for consistent usage, input, and output.
    * Add a master log browser in /admin to search and filter across all logs (quickactions, objectives, iteration).
  2. Markdown and Image Preview in Admin
    * Render all images in objectives/iteration logs as previews in /admin (not just Markdown links).
    * Add "open full-size" or "download" controls for images.
  3. Mobile/Touch Upload & Logging
    * Build mobile-friendly /admin pages for drag-and-drop or tap-to-upload from phone/tablet.
    * Add simple mobile logging (text + image, single action).
  4. Quick Objective/Activity Entry
    * Add a /admin/new_objective.php and /admin/new_activity.php for direct entry‚Äîsingle field, submit, logged and notified instantly.
  5. Log Entry Linking & Threading
    * Allow linking between activity/objective/iteration entries for audit trails and grouping.
    * (Optional) Add tagging or simple hashtags.
  6. Failure/Error Analytics
    * Dashboard for viewing all entries in /opt/webstack/logs/failure.log.
    * Summary stats for top errors, time-of-day, source.
  7. Security & Access Control

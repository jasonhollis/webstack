Ok let's see if we can make this the quickest release in our history.  I want another tab in the admin nav bar/page called roadmap.  It needs to work similar to objectives and iterations e.g. markdown driven with rendering but with not revision management via update_version.sh etc.  you can view objectives and iteration log pages yourself what other files do you think you need to review?

And I thought this would be the fastest release ever ... What else should be in the roadmap.  I want you to use your access to /admin and study all the data in objectives and iteration logs and then your own context to come up with all available options or brainstorming for the roadmap.md

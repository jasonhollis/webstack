*Last Updated: Monday, August 12, 2025 - 18:50 Melbourne Time*

## Current Version: v2.0.2
## Next Major Milestone: v2.1.0 (Database Logging Infrastructure)

---

## üóÑÔ∏è v2.1.0 - Database Logging Migration (August 2025) [ACTIVE]

### Overview
Complete migration from file-based logging to database-driven logging system. All Python scripts already in place (update_version.py, failure.py, snapshot_webstack.py) making this migration straightforward.

### Phase 1: Parallel Logging Implementation (Week 1)
- [ ] Add DatabaseLogger to update_version.py with dual logging
- [ ] Add DatabaseLogger to failure.py with dual logging  
- [ ] Add DatabaseLogger to snapshot_webstack.py with dual logging
- [ ] Keep existing file logs as backup during transition
- [ ] Test all operations with both logging systems active

### Phase 2: Fallback Mechanism (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Enhance DatabaseLogger with queue/retry logic
- [ ] Create single emergency.log for database outages
- [ ] Implement automatic queue flush via cron (every minute)
- [ ] Add database health check monitoring
- [ ] Test fallback scenarios (stop MySQL, verify emergency logging)

### Phase 3: Admin Tools (Week 2)
- [ ] Create /admin/log_viewer.php with real-time streaming
- [ ] Add SQL query interface for log analysis
- [ ] Build log export functionality (CSV/JSON)
- [ ] Implement log search and filtering
- [ ] Create bin/logs.py CLI tool to replace tail/grep

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Validation (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Run parallel logging for 2 weeks minimum
- [ ] Compare file logs vs database logs for completeness
- [ ] Monitor database performance impact
- [ ] Verify emergency.log triggers properly
- [ ] Document any edge cases discovered

### Phase 5: File Log Deprecation (Week 5)
- [ ] Archive all existing log files to compressed backup
- [ ] Remove file logging code from Python scripts
- [ ] Update all documentation and CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Keep only emergency.log as fallback
- [ ] Set up 90-day retention policy in MySQL

### Benefits
- Single source of truth for all system logs
- SQL querying instead of grep/awk
- Automatic retention management
- Remote access via admin panel
- Linked operations (errors ‚Üí operations ‚Üí versions)
- Better performance with indexed searches

### Safety Net
- Server snapshots available for full rollback
- Dual logging period ensures no data loss
- Emergency.log maintains critical path during DB outages
- All changes reversible until Phase 5

### Success Metrics
- Zero lost log entries during migration
- Query performance <100ms for common searches
- 99.9% logs in database (0.1% in emergency.log acceptable)
- Admin panel load time <500ms
- Successful recovery from simulated DB outage

     timestamp DATETIME,
     snapshot_path VARCHAR(255),
     git_commit VARCHAR(40),
     changes TEXT,
     status ENUM('success', 'failed', 'rolled_back')

## Color Flexibility Considerations

For maximum color flexibility, look for videos that:
1. Have neutral/monochromatic base colors (easier to tint with CSS filters)
2. Use particle effects rather than solid shapes (blend modes work better)
3. Have good contrast between elements (maintains visibility with overlays)

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Use CSS filters for color adjustment:**
   ```css
   filter: hue-rotate(180deg) saturate(1.5) brightness(0.8);
   mix-blend-mode: screen;
   ```

2. **Optimize with opacity:**
   ```css
   opacity: 0.3-0.6; /* Subtle background effect */
   ```

3. **Consider format conversion:**
   - Convert .mov to .mp4 for better browser support
   - Create .webm version for modern browsers
   - Use poster frame for initial load
